# **QuickSupply — Weekly Inventory Tracking & Demand Monitoring System**

## 🔥 **Project Overview**

QuickSupply Distributors Ltd manages multi-location FMCG distribution where inconsistent stock movement, frequent stockouts, and lack of visibility were disrupting operations. This project delivers an automated, scalable weekly inventory system—capturing field data, transforming it, storing it centrally, and turning it into actionable insights. The solution enables data‑driven decisions on stocking, demand patterns, and supplier performance.

---

## 💼 **Problem Statement**

* 📍 Inventory demand varies significantly by location.
* ⚠️ Chronic stockouts on key items while others remain overstocked.
* 🚚 Supplier delays create unreliable replenishment cycles.
* 🔍 No unified view of weekly inventory movement across branches.
* ⏱️ Manual processes slow decision-making and reduce operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

* 📱 Automate weekly data collection via KoboToolbox.
* 🧹 Standardize submissions from all branches into clean, unified datasets.
* ⚙️ Build a Python ETL pipeline for ingestion, transformation, and loading.
* 💾 Store cleaned data in PostgreSQL (schema: `quicksupply`).
* 📊 Develop Power BI dashboards for demand, performance, and supplier reliability.
* 💡 Deliver insights to guide stock distribution and strategic procurement.

## 🛠️ **End-to-End Architecture**

1. 📝 Field officers submit weekly forms via KoboToolbox.
2. 🔌 Data pulled programmatically through the REST API.
3. 🔄 Python ETL processes: structure fetch → XML mapping → renaming → cleaning.
4. 💾 Data loaded into PostgreSQL table `weekly_inventory`.
5. 📈 Power BI connects live to PostgreSQL for automated insights.
6. 📊 Outputs include demand trends, stock movement, slow movers, and supplier metrics.
